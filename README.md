## Starting
### Deploying remotely
Bot uses Docker+Docker Compose for deployment.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Tapeline/Sdamgiabot.git
cd Sdamgiabot
docker compose up -d
```
Provide `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable when starting Compose.

### Running locally
For running locally bot requires `wkhtmltopdf` installed. More info
about this requirement at [imgkit page](https://pypi.org/project/imgkit/)
and [wkhtmltopdf page](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/). 
> **Attention!**
> 
> On Windows you must explicitly pass the path to `wkhtmltoimage.exe`
> through env `WKHTMLTOIMAGE_BIN`

All pip requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage
Bot supports several commands (no buttons, because I'm too lazy)

All info about them is listed in `/help`
